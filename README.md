# JSF CRUD Application

## Overview
This project showcases a fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with JavaServer Faces (JSF) and JDBC for managing database interactions. It demonstrates effective handling of HTTP requests and various database operations through a web-based interface.

## Features
- **Create**: Seamlessly add new entries to the database via an intuitive form submission process.
- **Read**: Fetch and display a comprehensive list of entries from the database in an organized manner.
- **Update**: Easily edit existing entries by pre-populating a form with current values.
- **Delete**: Remove entries from the database with a straightforward confirmation step.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **JSF** (JavaServer Faces): Framework for building the user interface.
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity): For database communication.
- **MySQL** (or any relational database): Used for data storage.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing front-end forms and tables.

## What I Learned
- **Understanding JSF**: Gained practical experience with JavaServer Faces, focusing on creating dynamic interfaces and managing application state.
- **Database Interaction**: Acquired skills in using JDBC for effective database connections and CRUD operations.
- **Web Application Structure**: Developed insights into the architecture of Java web applications, including managed beans, JSF components, and HTML/CSS integration.
- **Form Handling**: Enhanced abilities in processing and validating user input through forms.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error management techniques to improve user experience and application reliability.
